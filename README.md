## API Key

This app uses the Forkify API to fetch 1.000.000 food recipes. You will need to obtain an API key from [Forkify](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/) and create `apikey.js` file in `js` folder then store your API key in `API_KEY` variable then `export default`that variable.


> apikey.js
```javascript
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
export default API_KEY;
```
